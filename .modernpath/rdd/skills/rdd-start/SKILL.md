description: Enter a delivery session — verify the process-store binding and active release, reconcile answered gates, take or prompt for the work scope, and route to the phase the loop actually needs, holding commit and check discipline for the whole session. Use at the start of any product-work session; when asked to start, continue, or pick up requirement-driven work; and whenever the question is what to work on next, where the loop stands, what is waiting on a decision, or what is blocked. Not a substitute for any phase skill.

# Start a delivery session

Read the project `AGENTS.md` and the canonical `PROCESS.md` — installed at
`.modernpath/rdd/PROCESS.md` in a consuming repository — before anything else.
`PROCESS.md` owns trace, status, gate, evidence, and completion meanings.

## Preflight — before any work selection

1. Identify the authoritative process store (store-backed or file-backed) and
   confirm it is reachable. In a store-backed repository, confirm the binding
   identity from the store itself, never from a number quoted in instructions;
   report binding drift as a defect, not a variance.
2. Confirm the release registry holds exactly one active release with a
   `USER:` source. No active release, or more than one, stops selection until
   a human answers.
3. Reconcile answered human gates and apply their consequences, then list the
   pending human decisions — only `OPEN` human gates with current passing
   prerequisites.
4. Refresh the session's working-set snapshots and check each file's snapshot
   header against the store revision. A stale snapshot is refreshed, never
   edited.
5. Count the suspended selections. More than one is a preflight fact: report
   each with its suspended status and reason, and name the mitigation —
   resume one, release one — before selecting new work.

The pending-decision projection may already have been delivered into the
session by the host — a session-start brief injected as context rather than
requested. That is the store's own answer arriving early, not ambient
background: date it against the store revision before relying on it, and
refresh it when it cannot be dated. A projection whose currency is unknown is
reported as unknown, never presented as current.

An unmet preflight fact is the report. Do not select work past it.

## Take the scope

Accept the work scope as the argument: an Epic id, a single SR id, or a raw
request. Without one — including when the request is an orientation question
rather than a scope — answer from the store: read the pending human decisions
and the routed `PROPOSED`/`TODO` queue through the store's own projection
read, present them, and ask the human to choose. Never pick a release
commitment silently.

Version control, change lists, and the working tree describe the repository,
not the loop. They are never the source for what to do next; a session that
answers an orientation question from them has skipped this skill.

Rank what you present by what a single human answer releases: an `OPEN` human
gate holding built `IN_REVIEW` work outranks unstarted work, and a gate
holding many items outranks one holding few. State the distribution across
awaiting-decision, ready-to-build, and awaiting-acceptance. A queue whose
awaiting-acceptance bucket dwarfs its ready bucket is a finding about where
the loop is stalled — report it as one rather than leaving the reader to count
rows.

Freeze the selection per `PROCESS.md` work scope and record it in the
work-selection record. Packet depth is proportional to the frozen scope; no
packet item may be omitted.

## Hold the session discipline

These rules bind every subsequent phase in the session:

- run the project's deterministic process checks before every commit, chained
  so a failure stops the commit — the expected RED of a red-first waypoint is
  the one failure that does not (see `rdd-build`);
- read the store's projection before any claim about readiness or state; a
  claim made from memory of an earlier read is not a fact;
- timebox the diagnosis of a tooling failure; when the box closes, surface the
  gap through the project's channel and continue on a read-only path or stop.
  Never mutate a shared store to test a hypothesis;
- a direction the human has given twice is a decision: record its `USER:`
  source and proceed on it rather than re-planning around it;
- commit at waypoints — specification, expected RED, GREEN, cleanup,
  reconciliation — with RED evidence committed before the change that
  satisfies it, so red-first is auditable in history;
- work on a reviewable feature branch and preserve RED and passing
  fingerprints;
- route a discovery through `rdd-triage` to the earliest phase it
  invalidates; never silently widen the frozen scope.

## Route

Select the earliest unmet prerequisite for the frozen scope and hand off to
its skill: `rdd-discover`, `rdd-plan`, `rdd-cold-review`, `rdd-entry-review`,
`rdd-build`, `rdd-verify`, `rdd-completion-review`, or `rdd-deliver` for the
complete loop.

## Report

Report the store binding and how it was confirmed, the active release and its
source, pending human decisions, the frozen scope and fingerprint, and the
phase entered — or the exact preflight fact that stopped the session.

Repository and process work that carries no requirement record — tooling,
instructions, delivery infrastructure — is reported separately and labeled as
such. It is real work and may be urgent, but it is not what the queue is
asking for and never substitutes for the queue in the answer.
