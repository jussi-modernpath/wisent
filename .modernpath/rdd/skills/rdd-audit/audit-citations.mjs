// Every `file:line` a document claims must resolve. This was re-derived by hand
// five times in one session and was wrong three of those — a regex whose
// non-greedy alternation matched `.ex` inside `.exs`, a display truncated at
// column 46 that made six correct citations look wrong, and a sweep that covered
// one subset while reporting a fraction as if it covered the corpus.
// Those are the three failures this file exists to stop repeating.

//     file on purpose;
//   * an illustrative quotation — prose showing how to write a good finding,
