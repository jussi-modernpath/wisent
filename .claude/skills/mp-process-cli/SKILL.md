description: Operate the requirement-driven delivery loop through the modernpath CLI — the exact verb sequences for plan, cold review, entry, build, evidence, completion and apply; the work-selection model; the three fingerprints and what moves them; every refusal the loop meets and the verb that clears it. Use whenever an rdd skill says to record, select, pull, push, trace, gate, answer or advance and the workspace is store-backed; flags and defaults are in the installed `.modernpath/cli-reference.md`.

# Operating the loop through the CLI

<!-- TOOL-OWNED. Installed by `modernpath install`. -->

The rdd skills say *what* a pass records; this skill says *how* the `modernpath`
CLI records it. Nothing here changes the process — `.modernpath/rdd/PROCESS.md`
owns the meanings. Every verb, flag and default of the installed binary is in
`.modernpath/cli-reference.md`, rendered from the binary itself by
`modernpath install`; look a flag up there rather than guessing it. Every command below is the sanctioned path: if a step needs
something the CLI does not expose, that is a tooling gap to surface through the
project's gap channel, never a reason to call the API or edit a store file by
hand (`PROCESS.md` §State records and reconciliation).

Sections marked **store-backed** apply only when `process/store-backed.md`
declares the store; in a file-backed workspace the ledger files are the store
and `modernpath author` is a rehearsal tool, not a write path.

Two rules from the project's agent instructions apply throughout: one store
command per shell call, and store writes only from the orchestrating session —
a delegated pass returns findings and a verdict.

`PROCESS.md` names phases and never a verb. In a store-backed workspace each
phase is driven by these entry points; the sections below give the order and
the flags:

| Phase (`PROCESS.md`) | Verbs | Section |
|---|---|---|
| any — where do I stand | `process next`, `process check --phase <p>`, `your-move`, `factory status` | Where the loop stands |
| source → plan | `working-set select … --phase plan [--lane defect]`, `working-set pull --scope`, `working-set push` | 1 |
| cold review | `working-set pull --scope --for-review`, `process findings add` / `disposition`, `author trace --purpose cold-review` | 1 |
| entry | `process enter <scope>`, then the human's `factory answer`, then `author advance … --to TODO` | 1 |
| build → verify | `factory evidence --fail --role RED`, `factory evidence --pass`, `process advance <SR>` | 2 |
| completion → apply | `process complete <scope>`, then the human's `factory answer`, then `author advance … --to DONE`, `working-set select --put-down` | 2 |
| triage | `author requirement` / `author epic` / `author backlog`, `author gate --gate-kind question`, `modernpath feedback "<line>"` for a tooling gap | The write channels |
| session | `auth status`, `env --set`, `factory status` | Where the loop stands; the reference |

## Where the loop stands (both modes)

| Read | What it answers |
|---|---|
| `modernpath process next` | the derived phase, why, and the skill to run; `-v` prints the full packet aggregate and process revision |
| `modernpath process check --phase <p>` | one phase's decision-table checks for the current selection (a pure read) |
| `modernpath your-move` | the pending human decisions, ranked by what one answer releases |
| `modernpath working-set pull <id>…` | a record as a readable file with its `Fingerprint:` line |
| `modernpath factory gates <gate-id>` | one gate: state, answer, chosen options, applied state |
| `modernpath factory status` / `modernpath status` | the binding and whether the workspace is store-backed |

Phases are `source`, `plan`, `cold_review`, `entry`, `build`, `verify`,
`completion`, `triage` — the vocabulary `--phase` accepts.

## The write channels (store-backed)

Every write is single-record and actor-attributed; legality is enforced by the
server, and a stale fingerprint conflicts instead of overwriting. Retired files
are not recreated to record something — a file-derived batch is refused whole.

| Channel | Carries |
|---|---|
| `modernpath author requirement`, `author epic`, `author update`, `author member`, `author relate` | records, content edits, membership and UR–SR relations |
| `modernpath author trace` | an immutable PASS/FAIL/STALE trace gate at an exact fingerprint |
| `modernpath author gate` / `author gate-withdraw` | a human gate, born open; `--supersedes <old>` retires an open or answered decision in the same write; a mistakenly opened one is withdrawn with a reason |
| `modernpath author advance` | a lifecycle transition; a human-gated one names the `ANSWERED` gate and its fingerprint |
| `modernpath working-set select` | the frozen scope, its phase, suspension, resumption, put-down |
| `modernpath working-set push` | packet sections whole and item files as atomic patches, from the scope directory `pull --scope` materialized |
| `modernpath process findings add` / `disposition` | cold-review findings and their dispositions |
| `modernpath process reconcile --apply` | the automatic transitions current trace proofs allow |
| `modernpath process enter`, `process advance`, `process complete` | the ceremony verbs (EPIC-CLI-017): the entry gate, the lower trace plus reconcile, and the delivered-revision evidence plus completion trace plus completion gate — each from the store facts, each refusing before any write on an unmet fact |
| `modernpath factory evidence` | a test or browser run as evidence, pinned to the repository HEAD; `--role RED` marks a red-first result |
| `modernpath factory answer` | an attributable human answer on an open gate (a governed gate's review is attached for you) |
| `modernpath author backlog` / `author update --kind backlog` | one backlog, gap or tooling record (`BACKLOG-…`, `GAP-…`), born `OPEN` and attributed to you; a disposition change names its `--source`; `working-set pull <id>` renders it |

A triage discovery that is neither a requirement, an epic nor a gate is a
backlog record (`author backlog <id> --kind backlog`), a gap is `--kind gap`
with its `--gap-kind`, `--affected-trace` and `--consequence`, and a tooling
gap is `modernpath feedback "<line>"`. The release registry file is retired;
the single active release and its `USER:` source are the answered
`release_selection` gate `GATE-RELEASE-<slug>`.

## 1. Plan → cold review → entry (store-backed)

**Take the scope.**
`working-set select <EPIC|SR> --kind epic|single_sr [--members a,b] --phase plan [--lane defect]`
(`--lane defect` marks a customer-blocking defect: `process next`, `your-move`
and the session brief say so, and the defect-lane rules of `rdd-start` apply).
A take with no `--replaces` *adds* a holder — you may hold several pieces; name
the one you are displacing with `--replaces <piece> --outcome done|obsolete|returned=<phase>`.
Advance the phase later with `working-set select <scope> --phase <p>`.

**Author the packet.** `working-set pull --scope` materializes
`.modernpath/working-set/<scope>/` — item files and `packet/*.md` sections —
under an authoring context. Edit, then `working-set push` (`--dry-run` first).
Until the push order is fixed in the tool: a member-record patch and its packet
sections may go in one push: item patches post first, and every filled section
the server then reports as stale is re-put unchanged so it carries the current
stamp — the push says `re-stamped N section(s)`, never "nothing to do"
(`--restamp` forces every filled canonical section). The scaffold reads the
required keys the server serves (`facts.sections.required`), so the stubs and
`process check --phase plan` walk one key set; a FAIL on `canonical_sections`
names the missing or stale keys.

**Cold review** runs from an independent context and records from it:

1. `working-set pull --scope --for-review` — a read-only render that stamps a
   review context. Pushes from it are refused by design.
2. Read the full aggregate: `process next -v` → `full packet_fingerprint:`.
   The unadorned line is a 12-character display prefix that `--fingerprint`
   accepts and never matches.
3. Findings: `process findings add --scope <kind>:<id> --id <F-id> --category
   <c> --severity <s> --owner <o> --body … --aggregate <full aggregate>` —
   both `--category` and `--severity` are required (the CLI never defaults to
   the most blocking pair), and a `--severity note` never blocks whatever its
   category; `process findings list` prints severity, per-round counts and
   flags a round whose material findings are all `traceability` (audit the
   change, not the document); `process findings disposition --id <F-id>
   --disposition RESOLVED|DEFERRED|REJECTED --expected-fingerprint <from list>`.
   Material categories are `correctness`, `security`, `data_loss`, `contract`,
   `traceability`, `testability`; a material finding left `OPEN` **or
   `DEFERRED`** fails the check — an out-of-scope pre-existing finding is
   `REJECTED`, not deferred. Findings are scope-scoped, not aggregate-scoped.
4. Verdict: `author trace CR-TRACE-<scope>-R<n> --purpose cold-review
   --verdict PASS|FAIL --scope <epic> --scope <each member> --source …
   --title …`. The pin defaults to the scope's current packet aggregate and
   the transition to `plan->entry` (REQ-CROSS-376/377); a given
   `--fingerprint` must be the full 64-character hash of the right class (a
   display prefix or a content hash is refused by name; a full hash matching
   nothing is recorded with a warning), and a transition is `--from`/`--to`
   or one quoted `--transition FROM->TO` — a fragment is refused before any
   write. The trace inherits the review context the scope was pulled under; a
   verdict with no review context is refused, and one recorded from an
   authoring context reads as not independent.
5. `process check --phase cold_review` → `independent_verdict` and `findings`.

**Entry.** `modernpath process enter <scope>` does the ceremony from the store
facts: it refuses naming the fact when the packet sections are missing or
stale, when no independent passing cold-review trace exists at the current
aggregate, when members mix PROPOSED and PENDING_VERIFICATION sources, when
the `entry_brief` packet section is absent or incomplete, or when
`ENTRY-<scope>` is taken (`--gate-id ENTRY-<scope>-R2`); otherwise it opens the gate
naming the epic plus every member still in FROM (a single SR names itself),
the cold-review trace as prerequisite and `PROPOSED->TODO`, and moves the
selection to phase `entry`. `--dry-run` prints the plan. The brief is the
`packet/entry_brief.md` section in the PROCESS.md brief shape (`- What:`,
`- Why now:`, `- Changes if approved:`, `- Risk if wrong:`,
`- Recommendation:`; every bullet required), or `--brief-file`.

By hand — when the verb refuses for a fact you must record first, or on a
CLI or server that lacks it — record the entry trace (`author trace
ENTRY-TRACE-<scope> --purpose entry --verdict PASS --scope … --prerequisite
CR-TRACE-<scope>-R<n>`; the pin defaults to the packet aggregate), then open
the gate **naming the cold-review trace**:

```
modernpath author gate ENTRY-<scope> --purpose entry --gate-kind approval_request \
  --transition "PROPOSED->TODO" --scope <epic> --scope <each member> \
  --prerequisite CR-TRACE-<scope>-R<n> --prerequisite ENTRY-TRACE-<scope> \
  --option approve="Approve entry" --recommended-option approve --brief-file brief.json
```

Trace **before** gate: the gate is refused unless a named prerequisite is a
passing cold-review trace pinned to the current aggregate, and a gate cannot be
edited after birth. The gate scope is the epic plus **every member not yet
entered** — the server refuses a gate that names the epic but omits one — or
the single requirement; several items with no epic cannot be pinned. Members
of an epic that is already `TODO` are recovered by a members-only entry gate
naming them (its prerequisite is the epic's cold-review trace). Move the
selection: `working-set select <scope> --phase entry`.

**Answer, then apply.** The human answers in Mission Control or with
`factory answer ENTRY-<scope> --options approve` (a human decision; the CLI
attaches the review a governed gate needs). Answering records; it moves
nothing. Apply members first, then the epic:

```
modernpath author advance <member> --kind requirement --to TODO --expected PROPOSED \
  --gate ENTRY-<scope> --gate-answer approve --gate-fingerprint <gate Fingerprint>
modernpath author advance <epic> --kind epic --to TODO --expected PROPOSED --gate … 
```

`--gate-fingerprint` is the gate's content-shadow hash — the `Fingerprint:`
line of `working-set pull ENTRY-<scope>`. `--gate-answer` accepts the option
key, its label, or the stored answer text. The gate closes and reads
`applied` once every named transition has landed.

## 2. Build → evidence → completion → apply (store-backed)

The operator records evidence; the tool does the ceremony (EPIC-CLI-017).

1. `working-set select <scope> --phase build`.
2. **RED**, recorded at the RED commit: `factory evidence --fail <SR> --role
   RED --kind local_test --log "<command>"`, or later with `--revision
   <red-commit>` (no checkout). Evidence currency is role-aware: a RED never
   shadows a passing result, and the server warns at record time about a pass
   with no RED before it or a RED recorded after a pass.
3. **GREEN**: `factory evidence --pass <SR> --kind local_test --log "<command>"`.
4. **Advance**: `modernpath process advance <SR> --log "<command>"` reads the
   facts of the piece that holds the SR (`--piece` when you hold several),
   refuses naming the fact (no RED recorded, evidence failing/claimed/stale,
   the SR not a member, no delivery facts served), records
   `TRACE-LOWER-<SR>` at the SR's content hash and reconciles until nothing
   remains — `TODO->IN_PROGRESS->IN_REVIEW` for the SR and the epic's own
   step. A second call reports nothing to do. Sibling transitions and FAILs
   are information; a FAIL naming the SR fails the verb.

   By hand: `author trace TRACE-LOWER-<SR> --purpose lower --scope <SR>
   --verdict PASS` (the pin defaults to the SR's content hash — the
   `Fingerprint:` line of `working-set pull <SR>`, never the aggregate or the
   git revision; the transition defaults to `build->verify`), then `process
   reconcile --apply` twice. An epic is held at `IN_PROGRESS` while any member
   carries a `STALE` member-scoped cold-review trace with no newer pass at
   member scope: re-record the member-scoped trace at the aggregate the pass
   reviewed, saying in its body that it reflects that review.
5. **Deliver** through the project's integration path, then check out the
   merged revision: completion runs at the **delivered revision**, the tip
   of the remote default branch.
6. **Complete**: `modernpath process complete <scope> --log "<ci run>"
   [--body "<audit and disclosures>"]` fetches the default branch and refuses
   unless HEAD is its tip (behind, or not on the branch, is named), refuses a
   member not `IN_REVIEW` (`process advance` it) or an epic not `IN_REVIEW`
   (`process reconcile --apply` folds it), then records one `ci` run naming
   the epic and every `IN_REVIEW`/`DONE` member at HEAD, records
   `COMPLETE-TRACE-<scope>` PASS at the packet aggregate, opens
   `COMPLETE-<scope>` naming that trace and the epic plus every member still
   `IN_REVIEW` (`OBSOLETE` and `DEFERRED` members are excluded and disclosed),
   with the brief from `packet/completion_brief.md` (or `--brief-file`), and
   moves the selection to phase `completion`. `--dry-run` prints the plan.
   The epic's user requirement is a member the facts serve, so the run, the
   trace and the gate name the epic and its user requirement `UR-<epic>`
   (`UR-<suffix>` for `EPIC-<suffix>`) while it is `IN_REVIEW`; it reaches
   `IN_REVIEW` through its upper trace by hand (`author trace TRACE-UPPER-<UR>
   --purpose upper --scope <UR> --fingerprint <its content hash> --verdict
   PASS`) and `process reconcile --apply` — `process advance` takes an SR. `working-set pull <epic>` lists only the SRs under
    **Members** — pull the UR by id to read its state.

   By hand, in this order: `factory evidence --pass <epic>,<UR>,<member>,…
   --kind ci --log "<run>"` (an epic or UR with no posted passing run of its
   own reads `:claimed` and the gate refuses with "not yet"); `author trace
   COMPLETE-TRACE-<scope> --purpose completion --verdict PASS --scope <epic>
   --scope <each member> --body …` (pin defaults to the aggregate, transition
   to `IN_REVIEW->DONE`); then the gate naming it, scoped to the epic, every
   SR member not yet `DONE` and the UR while it is `IN_REVIEW` — a gate that
   omits one is refused with `exact_scope: completion gate names <epic> but omits
    members not yet DONE: <ids>`:

```
modernpath author gate COMPLETE-<scope> --purpose completion --gate-kind approval_request \
  --scope <epic> --scope <each member> \
  --prerequisite COMPLETE-TRACE-<scope> --option approve="Approve completion" \
  --recommended-option approve --brief-file brief.json
```

7. The human answers (Mission Control, or `factory answer COMPLETE-<scope>
   --options approve --text "USER:<date>: …"`).
8. **Apply**, members first: `author advance <member> --kind requirement --to
   DONE --expected IN_REVIEW --gate COMPLETE-<scope> --gate-answer approve
   --gate-fingerprint <gate Fingerprint>` for every SR, then the UR (also
    `--kind requirement`), then the epic with `--kind epic`.
9. `working-set select <scope> --put-down --outcome done`; `process next` now
   reads complete or "no current selection".

### Retiring a gate that cannot be approved

A governed gate born with no prerequisite trace, or pinned under an aggregate
that has since moved, is unapprovable, and a gate id is opened once. Retire it
by superseding it with one that can pass:

1. Hold the piece: `working-set select <epic> --kind epic --phase completion`.
2. Read the **current** aggregate: `process check --phase completion -v --piece
   <epic>` prints `full packet_fingerprint:`. `process next -v` may answer
   `no route derived — entry_origin_unavailable` for an epic whose members are
   all `DONE`; it still prints the aggregate.
3. Record the completion trace at that aggregate (step 9), then open the
   successor naming both: `author gate COMPLETE-<scope>-2 … --prerequisite
   COMPLETE-TRACE-<scope> --supersedes COMPLETE-<scope>`. The old gate reads
   `superseded` in `factory gates <id>`; the new one carries the link.
4. Park the piece while the human answers, so your other held pieces stay
   unambiguous: `working-set select <epic> --suspend --reason "awaiting the
   completion answer" --waiting-on COMPLETE-<scope>-2`.
5. On the answer: `working-set select <epic> --resume`, `author advance` the
   SRs, the UR, then the epic (step 12), and `--put-down --outcome done`.

## 3. The work-selection model (store-backed)

- **One holder per piece; several pieces per person.** The constraint stops
  two people taking the same work and does nothing else. A take of a piece
  someone else holds is refused naming the holder; a suspended piece is
  claimable by anyone.
- **`--piece <scope>`** on `working-set` and `process` names which of your
  current pieces a read or write resolves. With several held and none named,
  every scoped read and write is refused by name — `process next`, `process
  check` and `process reconcile` print "you hold several current pieces (2):
  A, B — name one with --piece <id>", the server answers 409, and `factory
  status` lists
  what you hold; "no current selection" is printed only when you hold none.
  Name the piece.
- **Suspend / resume / claim / put down:** `working-set select <scope>
  --suspend --reason … [--target … --waiting-on …]`; `--resume <scope>`;
  a fresh take of a suspended scope claims it; `--put-down --outcome
  done|obsolete|returned=<phase>` closes it. Only a piece you currently hold
  can be suspended: to change a parked piece's reason, resume it first; the
  earlier reason stays on the closed row.
- **Re-read the selection immediately before mutating it.** A stale snapshot
  has displaced a colleague's live selection and closed it with the default
  outcome. `working-set check` reports stale files; `--refresh` re-pulls.
- The selection is caller-scoped: reads and writes resolve against the
  authenticated person's pieces, never a colleague's.

## 4. The fingerprint model (store-backed)

Three pins, one per trace class, named the same way everywhere: the
**packet aggregate**, the **content hash**, the **process revision**.
`author trace` reads the right one from the store when `--fingerprint` is
omitted and refuses a display prefix or the wrong class by name
(REQ-CROSS-376); the ceremony verbs never take one. Passing a wrong one by
hand records a trace that never matches and can never be removed.

| Trace | Pin to | Read it from |
|---|---|---|
| lower (an SR's `LOWER-<SR>`) | the SR's content fingerprint (its sync shadow) | `Fingerprint:` in `working-set pull <SR>` |
| cold-review, entry, completion | the packet **aggregate** of the scope | `full packet_fingerprint:` under `process next -v` / `process check … -v` |
| evidence (`factory evidence`) | the git revision | pinned to `HEAD` at record time |

A **human gate** has its own content-shadow hash (`Fingerprint:` in
`working-set pull <gate>`) — that is what `author advance --gate-fingerprint`
and `author update --expected-fingerprint` echo, and what a stale copy makes
conflict instead of overwrite.

What moves what:

- The **aggregate** folds the scope's member records and packet sections. It
  does not move on lifecycle changes or on git HEAD. Editing a **member
  record** moves the scope context and thereby the stamp on every sibling
  packet section; each section is re-stamped only by pushing changed content.
  Prefer editing a packet section over a member record when a fix can live in
  either.
- A packet section is stamped for its **own** scope's context, so a section on
  a member is judged against that member, not the ambient selection.
- A decision gate is pinned to the subject it **names**: an epic plus items
  pins to the epic; a single item to that item; several items with no epic is
  refused.
- Re-pulling `--scope` rotates the authoring context; the review context is
  stamped by `--for-review` and inherited by the cold-review trace.

## 5. Refusal glossary

`origin: cli` strings are printed by this binary; `origin: server` strings
arrive as `server <code>: <message>` or verbatim from a 422.

| `no current selection named %s is held by you` | cli | `working-set pull selection --piece X` for a piece you do not hold; the snapshot is left unchanged | name a held piece |
| `no route derived — <reason>` | cli | `process next` on a live selection with no phase to route — `entry_origin_unavailable` when every member is already `DONE`; not an error, and `-v` still prints the aggregate | nothing; read the aggregate from it or from `process check --phase completion -v` |

| `should be at most 255 character(s)` | server | a bounded authoring field — title, context code, source tag, decision ref, a finding or gate id, an option key — over 255 characters; the refusal names the field and nothing is written | shorten the named field; long prose goes in `--body` or `--detail` |
| `expected key=label — the option key is what an approving answer carries` | cli | a malformed `--option` | `--option approve="Approve entry"` |
| `already answered (first-wins)` | cli | a second answer on an answered gate | read it with `factory gates <id>`; open a successor if the decision changed |
| `phase … is invalid` / `state … is invalid` | server | a `--phase` outside the eight names, or a selection state the server does not know | use `plan`, `cold_review`, `entry`, `build`, `verify`, `completion` |
| `no system_id in … config.json` | cli | the command ran from a directory carrying its own `.modernpath/config.json` (`modernpath-core/` has one), resolving that binding instead of the workspace's — and a nested config *with* a system_id resolves silently to the wrong store | run every verb from the workspace root |
| `not connected — run 'modernpath factory connect --system <id>'` | cli | no binding | `factory connect --system <id>` (a human decision) |
| `server rejected the session token — expired, revoked, or issued for a different server` | cli | the session token lapsed | a human runs `modernpath auth`; the agent stops |
| `is not satisfied — see the FAIL checks above` | cli | `process check` found an unmet check | the named check says what to record |
| `reconcile reported … unmet transition(s)` | cli | proofs do not yet allow a transition | read the FAIL line; usually a missing trace or evidence |
| `a gate is opened once` | server | re-creating a gate id, including a withdrawn one | a new id; withdrawn ids stay reserved (`process enter/complete --gate-id <id>-R2`) |
| `this server serves no delivery facts` | cli | a ceremony verb against a server that predates the `facts` read | deploy the server; nothing was written |
| `no RED is recorded for` | cli | `process advance` before the red-first result | `factory evidence --fail <SR> --role RED` (at the RED commit, or `--revision`) |
| `the evidence for … reads failing, not passing` (or claimed, stale) | cli | `process advance` before the passing run, or after a drift | `factory evidence --pass <SR>` at the current revision |
| `mixes entry sources` | cli | `process enter` on members split between PROPOSED and PENDING_VERIFICATION | enter one group; open the other with `author gate --from PENDING_VERIFICATION --to TODO` |
| `behind the delivered tip origin/` | cli | `process complete` on an ancestor of the merged tip (a session that never pulled) | pull the merged tip |
| `is not on the delivered branch origin/` | cli | `process complete` on a branch commit | merge, then check out the merged revision |
| `could not fetch origin/` | cli | `process complete` offline or without a reachable remote | restore the remote; `--no-fetch` is for offline fixtures only |
| `has members not yet IN_REVIEW` | cli | `process complete` before every member advanced | `process advance <SR>` each |
| `--fingerprint must be a full 64-character hash` | cli | a display prefix on `author trace` | omit `--fingerprint` (the store's value is read) or pass the full hash from `process next -v` / `working-set pull <SR>` |
| `but the value given is the …` (`--purpose lower pins to the content hash, but the value given is the packet aggregate`) | cli | the wrong pin class on `author trace` | omit `--fingerprint`, or pass the class the purpose takes |
| `--transition must be FROM->TO` | cli | a shell fragment of an unquoted arrow | `--from`/`--to`, or quote the arrow |
| `must be a full 64-character hash for a … trace` / `must be FROM->TO` | server | the same shapes reaching the authored path from an older CLI | upgrade the CLI, or pass the full value / the pair |
| `still a prerequisite of` | server | withdrawing a gate another gate names | withdraw the dependent first |

## 6. Traps

- **255 characters** per bounded authoring field: title, context code, source
  tags, decision refs, ids, option keys. Over it the server refuses the whole
  write with a 422 naming the field (`should be at most 255 character(s)`);
  a length fault the schema does not catch is still a 422 with a reason.
  Long prose goes in `--body` / `--detail` where the verb has it.
- **A push that patches a member record moves the scope context.** The push
  re-stamps every filled section the server then reports stale and says so;
  if `process next` still drops to `plan` with `canonical_sections_incomplete`,
  `process check --phase plan` names the missing or stale keys — author those
  (an unfilled stub is never pushed), or `working-set push --restamp`.
- **The aggregate folds the server's compiled process revision.** An API
  deploy of a process repin moves every packet aggregate and stales every gate
  pinned before it (`gate_prerequisites_stale`, "The planning scope changed").
  `process next -v` prints `full process_revision:` — compare it with the one
  the gate was born under before blaming the packet.
- **Several held pieces, none named.** Every scoped read and write refuses by
  name ("you hold several current pieces (…): … — name one with --piece <id>"; the server
  answers 409); `factory status` lists what you hold. Pass `--piece <scope>`.
- **The snapshot header names the store revision the server sent**
  (`store <revision>`, from `x-modernpath-store-revision`), or says the store
  serves none; the CLI's own build is on its own `CLI build:` line. A store
  that serves no revision has not been given one at deploy — not a sign the
  content is stale.
- **The requirements read truncates at its limit** silently; a limit below
  the corpus size gives a wrong "highest id". Ids collide anyway when
  colleagues author concurrently — re-check before minting.
- **Prefer `--from`/`--to` to `--transition`**; a quoted `--transition
  "build->verify"` is still accepted, and an unquoted arrow now fails fast (the
  fragment is refused before any write) instead of landing on an immutable
  trace. Traces recorded with a fragment before REQ-CROSS-377 are inert and
  stay.
- **A withdrawn gate id stays reserved.** Re-scoping means a new id; the
  withdrawn gate may still shadow a finder until the sibling fix lands.
- **A `your-move` label is not a gate id.** Cross-check `external_id` and
  title before reporting a gate as ready or answered.
- **Verify the whole guard, not the first firing arm.** Entry and completion
  refusals are multi-arm; the first message is true but not the whole cause.
- **Record RED evidence before GREEN**, at the RED commit — or afterwards with
  `--revision <red-commit>`; a RED never shadows a pass, and the server warns
  at record time about either ordering mistake. Run `mix` or `go` evidence
  commands from the project's documented root — and every `modernpath` verb
  from the workspace root, never from a subdirectory that carries its own `.modernpath/config.json`.
- **The on-PATH binary can lag `main`.** A merged CLI change is not usable
  until the binary is rebuilt and `modernpath install` has run; a server
  change is not live until deployed. Check `modernpath --version` against
  the merge before relying on a new verb.
- **Session tokens expire mid-session.** The remedy is interactive; report it
  and stop rather than retrying.
