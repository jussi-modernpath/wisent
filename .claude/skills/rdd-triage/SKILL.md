# Triage a discovery

Read `PROCESS.md`, the selected Epic and its current saved plan, plus relevant
source, code and test evidence. Preserve native IDs.

1. Classify the discovery: behavior within approved scope, changed acceptance
   or scope, implementation defect, external blocker, contradictory source,
   or future work outside the Epic.
2. Continue red-first work for a defect within approved behavior.
3. For a material change in user outcome, acceptance, architecture or scope,
   revise the saved plan through `rdd-plan` only while the Epic is `PROPOSED`;
   implementation waits for human approval. Once implementation is approved,
   keep the active plan and owned requirements read-only, surface the change
   as a human decision and record new work separately for its own plan and
   human implementation approval. Continue unaffected work within the active
   approved scope.
4. Ask the human to resolve intent that sources cannot establish. Record the
   decision through the sanctioned interface before relying on it.
5. Disclose blockers, assumptions and deferred work. Do not silently add
   another Epic, invent a local record, or declare a process-tool refusal
   cleared.

Report evidence, affected native items, the earliest needed phase and what
remains incomplete.
